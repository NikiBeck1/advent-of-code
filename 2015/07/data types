scalar - means we have 1 of something
(number, string)

list - have 0 or more scalars
(array, stack, heap)

map - 2 lists of scalars and each item in the first list has a corresponding item in the second list
(object, hash, dictionary)

* the item in the first list is called the key and the corresponding item in the second list is the value

{
    a:1,
    b:'xyz'
}

you can always get a list of keys and the corresponding list of values
given a key, you can always look up the corresponding value
it is NOT certain that you can look up a key from a value
each given key is unique
